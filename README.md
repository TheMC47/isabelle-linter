# Isabelle Linter
Linter for Isabelle, with jEdit integration.

## Setup
The linter can be used as a stand-alone tool or as a jEdit component.
Simply add this directory as component (`isabelle components -u <DIR>`).
For stand-alone usage, add the component `<REPO_DIR>/linter_base` **instead**.

## Usage
Either jEdit panel or `isabelle lint`.
